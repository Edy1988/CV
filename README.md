I am a Junior Full Stack Developer looking to learn from the best programmers in the community. After several months of exploring and self-teaching, I have applied to Makers Academy to kick start my new career. I have learned the key coding skills in Ruby, Javascript and git collaboration. As a very excited and keen beginner, I would love to work in a challenging and professional environment where I can accelerate my growth.

## Skills

*Communication*<br>
My background in maxillofacial and dental surgery has taught me a great deal about effective communication, even in very stressful, high stakes situations. 

*Believing in a good process*<br>
Although I am flexible and receptive to others, I love to follow good processes which help me track my progress and plan ahead. 

*Adaptability*<br>
I have managed busy referral radiography clinic and multispecialty operating theatre. This meant many unforeseen situations which taught me to use my resources optimally and solve problems one at the time. 

*Teamwork*<br>
I have learned that a good team is a key to the success of any endeavour. I have formed and managed effective teams, with a fabulous culture of support.

*Active contributor*<br>
I use my initiative and experience to always try and improve on what I do.

*Striving for more*<br>
I want to learn new things every day and get better at what I do. Whether at work or in personal life, I never settle -there is always room for improvement!
